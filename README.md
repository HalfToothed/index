# Index

Index is a calm, daily record of world events.

It is not a news app.  
It does not chase breaking updates, trends, or engagement.

Index presents each day as a structured document — clear, organized, and readable. No personalization. No algorithms. No infinite feed.

It is meant to be opened, read once, and closed.

## Install

Index is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

You can install it directly from your browser:

- Visit the app URL https://halftoothed.github.io/index
- Open the browser menu
- Select **“Add to Home Screen”** or **“Install”**

Once installed, Index runs like a lightweight app and supports offline access to previously loaded content.

## Source & Acknowledgment

Index uses Wikipedia’s [Current Events portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events) as its source.

This choice is intentional.

- Entries are human-curated, not algorithm-ranked  
- Events are structured by category  
- Language is neutral and factual  
- The format reflects a daily log, not a live feed
